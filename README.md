# [Preface](https://artelonga.com.br/pessoas/yurisugano/preface): I want to build a better world

## Where do I start?

day after day is a challenge </br>
work demands time and energy</br>
what's left is care for who I love</br>
then there is little left for me...

And for the rest of the world? 

## Organize the garden

the quest led me to neuroscience and art</br>
life and human ingenuity taught me about myself. </br>
I started thinking about my legacy </br>
my contribution to humanity and Earth

Legacy is what I leave behind when I go

## Plant the seeds

I build a better world through my legacy</br>
but life is short </br>
time is scarce </br>
there is little left for me.

How to build a legacy that makes me proud?

## Cultivate

pride is in the **construction** </br>
thinking about what to do today, or this year</br>
because everything I do</br>
influences my legacy too.

And what do I want to leave?
## Patience

I dream of a better world

The following are necessary *and sufficient* 

* define **objectives** for life
* find **communitis** that share these objectives
* colaborate with projects for the execution of these objectives

## Harvest

The first step is now

for that reason</br>
the seek for [[my objectives]] happens in public</br>
so the world enlightens me about my mistakes</br>
and the world learns from my success

in defining [[collective objectives]]
